\chapter{Preface}

The intent of this book is to share the techniques, knowledge, pitfalls, open problems, promising-looking future work/techniques, and literature of writing interpreters as relations in miniKanren.
%
Someone who reads this book actively should be ready to understand, implement, modify, and improve interpreters wtitten as miniKanren relations, read the related literature, and perform original research on the topic.

\section{What this book is about}

This book is about writing interpreters for programming languages, especially for subsets of Scheme.
While there are many books on writing interpreters, this book is unusual in that it explores
how to write interpreters as \emph{relations} in the miniKanren relational programming language.
By writing interpreters as relations, and by using the implicit constraint solving and search in the \texttt{faster-miniKanren} implementation, we can use the flexibility of relational programming to allow us to experiment with programs in the language being interpreted.  For example, a relational interpreter can interpret a program with missing subexpressions\footnote{Such programs are often called \emph{program sketches} [TODO cite].}, or \emph{holes}, attempting to fill in the missing subexpressions with values that result in valid programs in the language being interpreted.  Or we can give both a program containing holes and the value we expect the program to produce when interpreted, and let \texttt{faster-miniKanren} try to fill in the holes in a way to produce the expected output.  We can even write an interpreter that explicitly handles errors, and ask \texttt{faster-miniKanren} to find inputs to the program that trigger these errors.\footnote{This is known in the literature as ``angelic execution''.}

\section{What you need to know to read this book}

This book assumes you are familiar with the basics of Scheme or Racket, and are comfortable with the ideas of functionals programming.  The book also assumes you understand the notions of evaluation order of expressions, lexical scope, environments, environment-passing interpreters.

[TODO add topics that the reader should know, including Scheme, miniKanren, lexical scope, environment-passing interpreters, etc]

[TODO add pointers to resources]

\section{Running the code in this book}

The code in this book was tested with Chez Scheme and Racket.  It should be possible to run most code in other Scheme implementations, with few or no changes, with the exception of code that makes extensive use of Chez-specific or Racket-specific features, which I will point out in those chapters, as appropriate.

\section{Acknowledgements}

Dan Friedman and Michael Ballantyne both encouraged me to continue working on this book, and independently encouraged me to break down one giant book into more than one book, each book being more manageable.
%
Both Dan and Michael encouraged me to avoid getting bogged down with a lot of introductory material, which had caused me to abandon previous writing efforts.
%
Michael also encouraged me to continue working on the book in the open.

Darius Bacon wrote me a very helpful email about how using two separate lists to represent a lexical environment, rather than a single association list, can result in better performance and divergence behavior.  I had played around with this representation in the past, but had abandoned it before I understood its advantages.  Thank you, Darius.

My mother has continually encouraged me to work on this book, and most importantly, to finish it!

\chapter{A simple environment-passing Scheme interpreter in Scheme}% simple Scheme-in-Scheme %%%%%%%%%%

call-by-value (CBV) $\lambda$-calculus (variable reference, single-argument $lambda$, and procedure application), plus \verb|quote| and \verb|list|

association-list representation of the environment

empty initial environment

\verb|list| is implemented as if it were a special form rather than as a variable bound, in a non-empty initial environment, to a procedure.  As a result, although \verb|list| can be shadowed, \verb|(list list)| results in an error that there is an attempt to reference an unbound variable \verb|list|.

tagged list to represent closure

\chapter{Quine time}% Quine time %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

McCarthy challenge given in `A Micromanual for LISP'

\begin{alltt}

\end{alltt}
\verb|=>|
\begin{alltt}
((((lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0)))
   '(lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0))))
  (=/= ((_.0 closure)) ((_.0 list)) ((_.0 quote)))

\end{alltt}

\begin{alltt}

((lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0)))
  '(lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0))))
\end{alltt}

We replace \verb|_.0| with the arbitrary free variable name \verb|x| to produce the canonical LISP/Scheme Quine:

\begin{alltt}
((lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x)))
 '(lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x))))
\end{alltt}

\begin{alltt}
> ((lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x)))

((lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x)))
  '(lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x))))
\end{alltt}

Twines

every Quine is trivially a Twine; we can add a disequality constraint to ensure \verb|p| and \verb|q| are distinct terms

\begin{alltt}
> (run 1 (p q)
    (=/= p q)
    (evalo p q)
    (evalo q p))
[TODO add the answer]
\end{alltt}

\footnote{I thank Larry Moss and the Indiana University Logic Symposium [TODO check the name of the symposium] for inviting me to give a talk where I demonstrated Quine generation, and where Larry suggested I tried generating Twines.}

Thrines

\begin{alltt}
> (run 1 (p q r)
    (=/= p q)
    (=/= p r)
    (=/= q r)    
    (evalo p q)
    (evalo q r)
    (evalo r p))
[TODO add the answer]
\end{alltt}


Structurally boring Quines, Twines, and Thrines

\verb|absento| trick to generate more interesting Quines, Twines, and Thrines

\begin{alltt}

    (evalo p q)
    (evalo q p))
[TODO add the answer]
\end{alltt}

[similarly for Thrines]

Revisiting our original Quine query with the \verb|absento| trick

\begin{alltt}
(run 1 (p)
  (fresh (expr1 expr2)
    (absento expr1 expr2)
    (== `(,expr1 . ,expr2) p)
    (evalo p p)))
\end{alltt}

  (sym _.0)))
\end{alltt}


Gary P. Thompson II's Quine page (\url{http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm}) also describes \emph{Quine Generating Programs} (\url{http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/self_gener.txt}):

\begin{quote}
It is possible (and actually in some cases easier) to write a program which outputs another program which is itself a quine.
\end{quote}

\begin{alltt}

  (=/= q nq)
  (evalo nq q)
  (evalo q q))

((('((lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0)))
     '(lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0))))
   ((lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0)))
    '(lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0)))))
  (=/= ((_.0 closure)) ((_.0 list)) ((_.0 quote)))
  (sym _.0)))
\end{alltt}

\begin{alltt}

    '(lambda (_.0) (list _.0 (list 'quote _.0)))))
  (=/= ((_.0 closure)) ((_.0 list)) ((_.0 quote)))
  (sym _.0)))
\end{alltt}


[TODO: challenge to myself: generate a Kimian self-rep (\url{http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/self_kim.txt})

\begin{quote}
Kimian self-rep, like quines, got it's name from Godel Escher Bach.  A
Kimian 'program' is actually the error produced by the system when it
encounters the code.  Kimian self reps are therefore very system-specific,
and even implementation specific.
\end{quote}

I want to add errors to the interp, any way.  Once I've added errors, I should in theory be able to synthesize Kimian self-reps.  Try it!  And then move this description and code to the chapter that adds errors to the interp.

\chapter{Using a two-list representation of the environment}% split environment representation

association-list representation of an environment where \verb|x| is mapped to the list \verb|(cat dog)| and \verb|y| is mapped to \verb|5|:
\begin{alltt}

\chapter{Adding explicit errors}% explicit errors

So far our interpreters handle Scheme errors implicitly by failing to produce a result, rather than producing an explicit error.  This implicit representation of errors has advantages, in both keeping the implementation code simple and in performance/fail-fast behavior.

[TODO see the code and comments in \verb|mk-daily/2025_01_19| --- this code needs to be updated to use non-empty initial environment, to avoid unbound variable errors for built-ins, such as \verb|(error (unbound variable lambda))|]
